== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I use Payment Page? =

Once you've activated the Payment Page plugin, you'll be directed to a Quick Setup process to connect your payment gateway. Then, you can select a Payment Page template based on your business needs. Customize the template as you choose, and you'll be accepting payments in minutes. 

= What is the best WordPress payment plugin? =

There are many plugins available to receive payments on your WordPress site. We built Payment Page to be as simple as possible to set up and accept payments as quickly as possible. It only takes 60 seconds to start accepting payments with Payment Page if you already have a Stripe account set up. For PayPal, only 2-3 minutes. 

The speed is optimized by our Quick Setup process, which puts you right in the driver's seat to select your Template and connect your payment gateway in seconds. Templates are easily customized after import. 

We streamlined the entire process of creating flexible payment options for your customers with different currencies, payment frequencies, and intelligent filters that only display the relevant plans for customers to select.

We prioritized having a wide variety of payment options because many other solutions only support one gateway and a limited number of options. Flexibility is key in a world where we have so many digital wallets, customers potentially around the world, and consumer preferences demand streamlined payment flows. 

Because of some of these core tools, we believe Payment Page stands apart from the crowd. 

= What Payment Gateways are supported? =

Stripe and PayPal are currently both supported. We have plans to integrate other payment gateways including 2Checkout, Square, SecurePay, WorldPay, Authorize.net, Braintree Coinbase Merchant, Metamask, and more. Vote for the gateway you want to see on our [Roadmap](https://roadmap.payment.page/).

= What Stripe Payment Methods are supported?  = 

These are the Stripe payment methods currently supported: Credit & Debit Cards, ACH via Plaid, SEPA Direct Debit, Google Pay, Apple Pay, Microsoft Pay, Alipay, WeChat Pay. 

= What PayPal Payment Methods are supported? =

These are the PayPal payment methods currently supported: PayPal Standard Checkout, Credit & Debit Cards, Pay Later, Venmo, Bancontact, BLIK, eps,  giropay, iDEAL, Mercado Pago, MyBank, PRzelewy24, and SOFORT. 

= Are recurring subscription payments supported? =

Yes. The Personal Plan supports recurring subscription payments for Stripe, and PayPal is coming soon. 

= Are one-time payments supported? =

Yes. The free version of the plugin supports one-time payments for an unlimited number of pricing plans. 

= What kind of pricing options can I offer my customers? =

You can offer any plan you want! Payment Page is completely customizable and flexible for any kind of pricing plan you want to build, and if it’s not supported yet, just let us know and we’ll do what we can to add it. 

You can accept recurring subscription payments and one-time payments in any currency supported by your payment gateway. You can also let customers enter their own invoice or donation amounts for total control. They’ll even be able to choose to make it a recurring payment if they want to. 

= Can I receive custom payment amounts for invoices or other one-off payments? =

Yes. In the Personal Plan, a custom amount field is automatically displayed when any of your pricing plans don’t have a price entered into them. This allows the customer to enter the amount they want to pay on the frontend of the form. 

Read about Custom Payment Amounts in our [Documentation](https://docs.payment.page/pricing-options/custom-payment-amounts).

= Are custom form fields supported? =

Absolutely. You can add custom form fields in the Personal Plan. The data in these fields will get stored in the Stripe metadata for that Payment. 

= Can I prefill form fields automatically? =

Yes. When on the PRO plan, you can utilize Query String Parameters to automatically prefill all of your form fields, including custom fields. Query strings that match your custom fields’ labels will be matched to those fields. Unmatched query strings will be passed to HTTP Requests as well as Stripe metadata fields. 

Read more about pre filling form fields in our [Documentation](https://docs.payment.page/features/prefill-form-fields-query-strings).  

= What page builders are supported? =

Currently, Payment Page has an Elementor widget that you can drag and drop your form into any Elementor page. Elementor is a lightweight page builder that doesn’t dominate your website, and it can simply be installed in the background in order to use Payment Page on a single Elementor-based page.

We recognize that Elementor isn’t the only player, so we are planning support for Gutenberg Blocks, Divi, and potentially other major builders. [Contact us](https://payment.page/support/) or vote on our [Roadmap](https://roadmap.payment.page), as it will make a big impact as to what is prioritized in our development pipeline. 

= Can I send confirmation emails when a payment is received? =

The email confirmation functionality is in BETA, so please reach out to us if you would like enabled. We are building features based on demand.  

= How can I make feature requests or see your product development roadmap? =

Vote for new features or make requests on our [Roadmap](https://roadmap.payment.page/).

= Can I create automations based on payments? = 

Yes. We’ve included the ability to send HTTP Requests including all form fields (except sensitive payment details), as well as query string parameters that are submitted on the page.

By connecting this HTTP Request to an external URL endpoint - either one you code and build yourself or a service like Zapier - you can automate any process you want. 

Currently, HTTP requests are only supported for Stripe payment methods, as the verification flow for PayPal is more complex. Contact us if you need the PayPal HTTP Requests to be enabled. 

= Does Payment Page charge any additional fees on my payments through Stripe or PayPal? =

No. We don’t charge any fees on Stripe or PayPal payments. Please refer to their fee structures for more information about the fees associated with your individual payments. The only cost to use Payment Page is the monthly or annual subscription found on our [pricing page](https://payment.page/pricing/). 

= Where can I get support or submit bug reports? =

The Payment Page [Documentation](https://docs.payment.page/) is the best place to learn about Payment Page. You can also [submit a ticket](https://payment.page/support/) to the team.

= Where can I see your Privacy Policy and Terms & Conditions? =

Here are links to our [Privacy Policy](https://payment.page/privacy-policy/) and [Terms & Conditions](https://payment.page/terms-conditions/).
